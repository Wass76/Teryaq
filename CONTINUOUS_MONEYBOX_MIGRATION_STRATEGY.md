# Continuous Money Box Migration Strategy

## üìã **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the migration strategy from the current period-based Money Box system to the new Continuous Money Box approach. The migration is designed to be **non-disruptive**, **backward compatible**, and **phased** to minimize risk to production operations.

---

## üéØ **Migration Objectives**

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Implement Continuous Money Box** - Single source of truth for cash balance
2. **Maintain Backward Compatibility** - Existing sales/purchase operations continue unchanged
3. **Zero Downtime** - No interruption to business operations
4. **Gradual Transition** - Phased rollout with rollback capability

### **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ All existing Money Box functionality continues to work
- ‚úÖ New continuous approach is fully operational
- ‚úÖ Sales/purchase integrations remain functional
- ‚úÖ No data loss or corruption
- ‚úÖ Performance maintained or improved

## üîÑ **Data Migration Strategy**

### **Migration Script Overview**
```sql
-- Migration script to consolidate period-based boxes into continuous box
-- This script will be run during a maintenance window

-- Step 1: Create new continuous money box
INSERT INTO money_boxes (
    pharmacy_id, current_balance, initial_balance, status, 
    opened_at, opened_by, currency, is_active
)
SELECT 
    pharmacy_id,
    COALESCE(SUM(current_balance), 0) as current_balance,
    COALESCE(SUM(opening_balance), 0) as initial_balance,
    'OPEN' as status,
    NOW() as opened_at,
    (SELECT MIN(opened_by) FROM money_boxes WHERE pharmacy_id = mb.pharmacy_id) as opened_by,
    'SYP' as currency,
    true as is_active
FROM money_boxes mb
WHERE mb.status = 'OPEN'
GROUP BY pharmacy_id;

-- Step 2: Update transaction references
UPDATE money_box_transactions 
SET money_box_id = (
    SELECT id FROM money_boxes 
    WHERE pharmacy_id = (
        SELECT pharmacy_id FROM money_boxes WHERE id = money_box_transactions.money_box_id
    ) 
    AND is_active = true
    LIMIT 1
)
WHERE money_box_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM money_boxes WHERE is_active = false
);
```

### **Data Validation**
- [ ] Verify all transactions are properly linked
- [ ] Confirm balance calculations are accurate
- [ ] Validate reconciliation data
- [ ] Check audit trail integrity

## üõ°Ô∏è **Risk Mitigation**

### **High-Risk Areas**
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **Data Loss** | Low | High | Comprehensive backup before migration |
| **Performance Degradation** | Medium | Medium | Performance testing and monitoring |
| **Integration Failures** | Medium | High | Extensive integration testing |
| **User Confusion** | High | Low | Training and documentation |

### **Rollback Strategy**
```bash
# Rollback script to restore period-based approach
# This can be executed if critical issues arise

# 1. Disable continuous money box
UPDATE money_boxes SET is_active = false WHERE is_active = true;

# 2. Restore period-based functionality
# (Keep existing period-based code running)

# 3. Notify users of rollback
# 4. Investigate and fix issues
# 5. Plan re-migration
```
